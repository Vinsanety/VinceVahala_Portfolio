          From a small industrial town in Indiana, I grew up playing any sport imaginable in traveling leagues, in the backyard, or on a friend's outdoor basketball hoop. I attended Indiana University in beautiful Bloomington, Indiana where I studied at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, resulting in a B.S. in Environmental Management. I also studied at IU's Kelley School of Business, earning a minor in Marketing.

        <p>
          During my time at IU, I found the opportunity to travel abroad for a semester in Barcelona, Spain, studying Public Policy, the "Barcelona Model" of City Planning, Environmentalism, and Regional Recyclying and Composting programs. After graduation, I packed my Jeep up with all that would fit and moved to Colorado.

          Upon arriving in Colorado, I worked in Sales, IT Recruiting, Marketing, the Service-Industry and other odd-jobs before finding my passion in Web Development and Software Engineering. To transition into this industry, I went back to school at
          <a class="text-link" href="https://www.galvanize.com/web-development" target="_blank">Galvanize's Software Engineering Immersive</a>, a full-stack 6-month coding bootcamp. This is where I fell in love with the problem-sovling and design challenges of being a Software Engineer. Since graduating from Galvanize, I have been working full-time delivering responsive web-development and software solutions to both small businesses as an independent developer as well as the companies that I have been employed at. I love working on collaborative teams, tinkering with the latest technologies, and always expanding my design chops through researching the latest UX Patterns and UI interactions.
